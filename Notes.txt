Report Preview - First page or first couple pages

RTF, DOCX, PDF

He killed PDF because it was unstable. Had trouble with Latex.  Same with me.

Still one title and one subtitle.

No page numbering.  No page wrapping.  Titles don't repeat on next page.  Column headers will.
No footnotes on bottom of page.  Only one level of spanning headers.  
Can't set column widths in RTF.
Basically, he is not producing a report.  Just a table.

** Validation of Output - Does report output match input data **

Can it output data.frame for QC comparison?

Continued on next page...

Need to support special characters/unicode.  Another limitation of Latex/Rmarkdown.
Need to support scientific notation and mathmatical symbols in footnotes.

** Titles from Excel ***


Decimal alignment.

Locales for dates/times and currencies.


Wrapping long cell values and column headers.


Rich is working alone. Someone suggested he combine with Atorus Research (pharmaRTF people).


Creating tables in a loop.

Someone was working on getting bytecode into RTF.

XPT file.

Wanted statistical procedures to just output useable stuff.  

Some uses liked ability to reorder columns in the report.

Some wanted interactive tables: paging, dynamic column ordering, etc.  in HTML.
