The **reporter** package creates regulatory-style statistical reports. It was designed
to produce Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs) for the 
the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical-device industries.
However, the functions are generalized enough to provide statistical reporting
for any industry.  The package is written in Base R, and has no dependencies on
any other reporting package.

The package is intended to give R programmers flexible 
report layout capabilities 
and a choice of output formats. The package will 
initially focus on printable, file-based 
output formats, as there are already numerous R packages that 
provide tabular reporting in HTML. 
The current version supports TXT, RTF, and PDF output types.

license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0).  It is available 
for personal and organizational use, but cannot be used to create a commercial

## Key Features

The **reporter** package contains the following key features:

* Titles, footnotes, page header, and page footer are repeated on each page
* Supports header labels and spanning headers 
* Calculates default columns widths automatically
* Includes automatic wrapping and splitting of wide and long tables
* Integrates with the **fmtr** package to format numeric, date, and character data
* Plots from the popular **ggplot2** package can be added to RTF and PDF reports
* Allows appending multiple tables to a report, multiple tables to a page, 
and intermingling of text, tables, and plots
* Supports in-report date/time stamps and "Page X of Y" page numbering


## How to use **reporter**
There are four steps to creating a report:

* Create report 
* Create report content
* Add content to the report
* Write out the report 

You can create the report with the `create_report()` function.  Content is
created with the `create_table()`, `create_text()`, or `create_plot()`
functions.  Add content to the report with the `add_content()` function. 
Finally, the report can be written to a file with the `write_report()` function.  

In addition to these primary functions, there are several secondary functions
to help you formalize the report.  All available functions are shown in
the function [reference](https://reporter.r-sassy.org/reference/index.html).

Before diving too deep into the functions, however, it is recommended that you 
review some examples of the **reporter** package in action.  The examples
show a variety of common use cases.  You will see
