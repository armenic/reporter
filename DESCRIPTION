Title: Create regulatory-style tabular reports
Version: 0.0.0.9008
Author: David Bosak
Maintainer: David Bosak <dbosak01@gmail.com>
Description: Contains functions to create regulatory-style reports, such as 
    those that can be accomplished using SASÂ® PROC REPORT and ODS.  Primarily
    used for tabular reports, but also supports mixing tables and text. 
    Currently generates text file format, with plans to include RTF, PDF, and 
    DOCX in future releases.  The package specializes in printing
    wide and long tables with automatic page wrapping and splitting.  
    Reports can be generated with a minimum of function calls, and without 
    relying on RMarkdown or pandoc.  The package supports titles, footnotes, 
    page header, page footers, spanning headers, and automatic page numbering.
