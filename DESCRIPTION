Description: This package creates printable reports.  Currently supports 
    ASCII text file format, with plans to support DOCX, RTF, and PDF in 
    future releases.  The package specializes in printing
    wide and long tables, and supports automatic page wrapping and splitting.  
    Reports can be generated with a minimum of function calls, and without 
    relying on RMarkdown or pandoc.  The package supports titles, footnotes, 
    page header, page footers, and automatic page numbering.
