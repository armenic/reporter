Description: Contains functions to create regulatory-style statistical reports, 
    such as those that can be accomplished using SASÂ® PROC REPORT and ODS. 
    Currently generates text file format, with plans to include RTF, PDF, and 
    DOCX in future releases.  The package specializes in printing
    wide and long tables with automatic page wrapping and splitting.
